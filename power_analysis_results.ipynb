    "\n",
    "- Voltage regulation remains within ANSI C84.1 preferred limits for >97% of samples at all stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Power factor compliance is strongest at `SUB_001`; corrective actions could target the small number of low PF hours at `SUB_002`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load curves indicate evening residential peaks; consider demand response strategies to flatten the 17:00–20:00 window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No severe fault events detected, yet continued monitoring of reactive power excursions is advised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend monitoring to a full year to capture seasonal extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Integrate harmonic distortion measurements for deeper power quality assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Develop automated alerts when compliance metrics drop below 95% thresholds.\n"
