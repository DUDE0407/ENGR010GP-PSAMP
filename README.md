# ENGR 010 Group Project - Electrical Engineering Option

## Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. Data Management
- Import power system data from CSV files.
- Store measurements including:
  - Voltage
  - Current
  - Real power
  - Reactive power
  - Power factor
- Handle multiple grid nodes and time periods.

### 2. Analysis Features
- Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
- Identify load patterns over time.
- Compare measurements against grid standards.
- Calculate power quality indices.
- Perform basic fault analysis.

### 3. Visualization Features
- Create time series plots of electrical parameters.
- Develop power triangle visualizations.
- Build an interactive dashboard for system monitoring.

### 4. Learning Objectives
- Apply Python programming concepts in a real-world context.
- Gain experience with scientific computing libraries.
- Develop skills in data visualization and analysis.
- Practice collaborative software development.
- Experiment with Generative AI tools for assistance.

### 5. Technical Requirements
- Use variables, data types, control structures, functions, and data structures effectively.
- Implement scientific computing techniques:
  - Power flow calculations using NumPy.
  - Data manipulation using Pandas.
  - Create at least 3 different types of plots using Matplotlib.
  - Perform basic circuit analysis (e.g., RMS calculations, power factor correction).
- Add creative and interesting features to the application.

### 6. Submission Requirements
- Submit a Jupyter Notebook with code and written descriptions.
- Provide progress reports at weeks 9 and 12.
- Submit AI prompts with annotations explaining their use.
- Reflect on the use of AI for programming.
- Deliver a 5-minute final presentation with all team members participating.
